🚀 Making backend systems fast enough for the 5G era

## 🧠 About Me

I'm a **Java backend developer** working in **R&D at Jio Platforms Limited**, helping build the backend systems that survive **real-world 5G traffic**.

I spend my days designing APIs, optimizing performance, and questioning why it worked yesterday but not today. I like **clean code**, **scalable systems**, and **design that actually makes sense**.

## 🔧 Tech Stack (aka My Daily Toolkit)

**Languages**
- Java (because it never lets me go)
- SQL (talking to databases politely)

**Backend Stuff**
- Spring / Spring Boot
- REST APIs
- Microservices (yes, the fun kind)

**Databases**
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- Redis (because speed matters)

**Tools**
- Git (commit early, commit often)
- Docker (works on my machine™)
- Linux
- CI/CD

**Design**
- System Design
- API Design
- Performance Tuning (milliseconds matter)

## 🧪 Current Experiments

- Building backend systems that don’t panic under load
- Making APIs cleaner so future-me doesn’t suffer
- Breaking things in R&D so production can stay calm

---

## 😄 Fun Facts

- ☕ Java runs on coffee, so do I
- 🐛 Debugging is 90% reading logs, 10% pretending I knew it all along
- ⚡ I get unreasonably excited about performance improvements
- 🎨 I care about clean APIs almost as much as clean UI
